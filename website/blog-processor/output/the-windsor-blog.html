                    <h3>The Windsor</h3>

                    <p>Located on North Central Ave. in Phoenix, AZ lies my all time favorite restaurant-- The Windsor! Their website describes the place as “a neighborhood bar and restaurant” that offers “high quality wine and beer, prohibition era cocktails and casual and familiar bar food with an upscale twist.”</p>

                    <p>From the outside, guests are greeted with a beautifully rustic brick building, covered in lush greenery and outdoor seating. When first entering, they are met with an entire wall made of cassette tapes! You can often find patrons snapping photos with the “retro” backdrop of the cassettes or attempting to read the various albums/ artists that adorn the wall. Really, the best area to wait for an open bathroom stall. Once inside, one is welcomed by the moody aesthetic, complete with dark booths and dim lighting, a bar that takes center stage, dark green walls and eccentric art. To compliment the atmosphere, The Windsor always supplies an awesome playlist of some of my favorite artists, such as The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Talking Heads, to name a few!</p>

                    <p>Even when they are swamped, you can always count on one of the amazing Windsor staff to greet and seat you. The staff themselves seem almost curated to the very atmosphere that The Windsor exudes, oftentimes wearing hip, posh clothing and showcasing their individuality-- something The Windsor embraces not only from their staff, but the patrons as well! Over the years, I have made acquaintances with several of The Windsor employees, a couple of them have even become close friends indeed! It is hard not to strike up a conversation in such a welcoming place with welcoming people. I also enjoy how the staff basically “share” their tabling duties, so never be afraid to reach out to one of their wonderful employees-- they all share in accommodating patrons.</p>

                    <p>I haven&#39;t even gotten to the food and drinks yet! The Windsor is great at including just the right amount of dishes and swapping out new ones on a regular basis. I cannot tell you how much I dislike having to read through a giant menu! Simplicity is key in my book. Because I am a creature of habit, you can always count on me splitting the Windsor burger with fries and a side of ranch with my boyfriend. I am typically not a huge meat eater, but I can say in all honesty that the burgers made at The Windsor are fantastic and actually make me crave their deliciousburgers! The buttermilk ranch is also to die for! But what I truly love on the menu is their selection of craft cocktails. I have tried many of their cocktails over the years and they even introduce a weekly “bartender’s choice” if you are feeling adventurous. One that I hope never disappears from the menu is the #88, which includes gin and floral goodness that can only be described as “the nectar of the gods!” Pro tip: The Windsor offers a great happy hour deal with nearly half off cocktails from open to 5:00pm daily. I have been known to take advantage of happy hour, sometimes having two to three cocktails myself. How else would I be able to expand my palate and provide you with accurate reviews???</p>

                    <p>And if it couldn’t get any better, The Windsor offers dessert directly supplied from their sister establishment, CHURN, which is literally attached to the same building! Towards the end of your meal, you will be given a CHURN menu, which includes a variety of house-made ice cream flavors and cookies that serve as literally the cherry on top of the entire dining experience at The Windsor! You can even choose to turn an ice cream into a shake, and for that, I suggest the Vietnamese coffee flavor. Oftentimes, I will want my dessert to go, and the staff are so courteous, going so far as to even place my to-go cookie near an oven so as to keep warm.</p>

                    <p>In summary, although I am a big fan of all of the Upward Projects establishments, I can say wholeheartedly that The Windsor wins the gold! I cannot even count how many wonderful memories I have made at The Windsor, whether it was celebrating a birthday, going out on a romantic date or just catching happy hour for some drinks. I hope that The Windsor keeps on rockin &#39;and rollin&#39; for many years to come, and if you haven&#39;t already, go check it out!</p>

                    <h3>San Fransisco Adventures</h3>

                    <p>In May of this year, my partner and I made a trip to the iconic “city by the bay,” San Francisco. Although the primary cause of our trip was to see my favorite musician, Jack White, we made several memories both inside the concert and out!</p>

                    <p>With such a brief flight from our hometown of Phoenix, AZ, SF is one of our favorite weekend destinations, offering a nice contrast to our desert dwelling. Although SF can be pricey and parking is always questionable, it makes up for it with the bike/walkability. On our first morning, we made a short drive from our hotel and walked around a quaint city square where we happened upon a local shop: Dead Eye Coffee Bar. My iced beverage featured Ube, purple yam, often featured in traditional Filipino dishes that offers a deliciously creamy vanilla flavor. Consequently, we later encountered this ingredient when we ventured to a nearby bar and enjoyed Ube cocktails!</p>

                    <p>After our much needed caffeine, my partner and I visited the iconic Fisherman’s Wharf. My spirits were lifted when I learned that the seals were perched at their usual barge, barking and flailing about (last time we went they weren&#39;t there). I was also greeted by an adorable shop cat as we walked along the various purveyors-- I can’t ever get enough animal encounters! Exploring the Piers, we enjoyed a ride in these large 3D-printed seats that moved like a toy spinning top-- truly a sight to see! Of course, we also took the opportunity to snap some beautiful pictures of the Piers architecture and selfies by the water.</p>

                    <p>Leaving some room to rest, we then got ready for our highly anticipated Jack White concert at The Masonic. As we waited in line to enter the auditorium, I was reminded just how much I enjoy being surrounded by “my people”-- Jack White fans! As we waited, I admired all the patrons&#39; various Jack White (or adjacent) garb. I myself wore a corduroy jumpsuit with Jack White’s iconic black and blue color scheme, paired with leather white boots. After filing inside, we bought pricey cocktails (what do you expect at a concert venue!) and then headed right to the concert floor, where I managed to secure a close spot just right of center stage. While eagerly awaiting the show to start, I made a handful of friends out of those surrounding our little concert cove. Two of our fellow concert goers were from France, along with CA locals and we all swapped our Jack White fan stories.</p>

                    <p>The show opened with a local hard-core punk band named, THE LOSERS. Although a little too heavy for my liking, I am always impressed by Jack White’s efforts of showcasing localbands who are a little off the beaten path, so to speak. FINALLY!! The legendary Jack White graced the stage with his signature wild black hair, dawning a fashionably coordinated black and yellow outfit, courtesy of Third Man Records. Slightly less interactive than previous shows I&#39;ve been to, Jack mostly played songs from his latest album, NO NAME. Of course, Jack is always impressive live and I really enjoyed dancing my booty off with all the new friends I made! I am so good at making friends in fact, that I was even chosen as the designated bathroom chaperone on two separate occasions during the show. I must admit, I impressed myself even at my ability to weave through the crowd and then reenter, somehow finding my way back to our group close to the stage-- and this is after a few drinks no less!</p>

                    <p>After a meaty encore, Jack and the band took a final bow, left the stage and the lights came back on. One of the friends we had made, a SF local, approached us to ask if we wanted to “keep the party going,” to which we graciously obliged. After finding parking, we were led to Vesuvio Cafe. This place was so adorable and right up my alley! After ordering drinks, we scaled the tight spiral staircase and sat upstairs near a window, with a view to the side alley below, where a local band was serenading a gathering of people. I felt like I was in a quaint hip cafe in Europe, sipping drinks over conversation with the sound of live music flowing through the open window. After fetching another round, our trio made our way downstairs and outside, where we sat right by the band. Our local friend was acquainted with the band and told them of our concert, which inspired them (to my delight) to start playing “Hardest Button to Button,” by The White Stripes. With only an hour before bars start closing, we made our way to another bar in Little Italy called Gino &amp; Carlo. Once again, our friend knew the bartender and we enjoyed the rowdy late-night atmosphere of the vintage dive bar.</p>

                    <p>As we dropped our friend off and headed back to our hotel, I was awe-struck by our night-- something that can only happen organically. I can say for certain that we were lucky to have met the people we did at the right time and place. An experience that only made me love San Francisco even more and a night I will forever cherish!</p>

                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>This was truly one of the best nights of my entire life thus far, so I have decided to type it down to preserve the memory. Although this was not my first <a href="https://jackwhiteiii.com/" target="_blank">Jack White</a> (JW) concert, it was the first time I was "solo rollin'" on my own-- driving from AZ to L.A. Below, please find my fangirl account of attending Jack White's Supply Chain Issues tour-- L.A. show at the <a href="https://www.thebelasco.com/" target="_blank">Belasco Theater</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>After a lengthy car ride to L.A., I arrived at the venue one hour before the doors opened. Apparently that wasn't early enough-- the line was already wrapped around the budding! But waiting was super fun! I had never been around so many JW supporters and die-hards in my life! I enjoyed chatting with everyone about past concert experiences and JW facts, I also loved seeing everyone show off their t-shirts or even Jack costumes! In fact, I even took a picture with two gentlemen dressed as Jack!</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally the doors opened and the line began to spill in as we all locked our phones away in their designated pouches. When I entered the ornate theater I was amazed at the beauty-- but not for too long! The event was standing room only, so most people were rushing to the stage to get the closest spot available! I ran in and managed to get about 10 feet from the stage-- 10 FEET FROM JACK WHITE!!! I had gotten a wrist band indicating I was 21 and could drink, but there was NO WAY I was moving from that spot to get a drink or go to the bathroom!</p>
                    
                    <p>While everyone was anxiously waiting, that annoying DJ, who had been at all of Jack's shows for the Supply Chain Issues tour, was "entertaining us" with music. After an hour, the opening act came on-- Jack's wife, Olivia Jean. She was alright, most of her stuff sounded the same, and everyone was there for JACK!!!</p>
                    
                    <p>With the crowd beyond pumped up, Jack came out, energetically running across the stage as usual! I was immediately shocked to see his iconic Fear of the Dawn blue hair back to his original black-- but he looks great in any color! Jack began the show with "Taking Me Back" his guitar booms "BOM BOM" "BOM BOM" but then his amp cord gets ripped from his guitar-- I can't help but find it so charming when Jack gives a little embarrassed smile as he quickly shoves the cord back in. This is something that can be explained so much better through impersonation, but you get the picture!</p>
                    
                    <p>As the show goes on I really start to realize what a different concert going experience this is for me. Everyone around me is shoulder to shoulder, we are all sweating like mad, but there's also this shared energy that feels like nothing else. It was truly magical. Above the stage on either side were the VIP sections. I was immediately able to spot Conan O'Brian and Jack Black. But then again, the VIP couldn't catch the picks or the sweat towel that Jack threw to the crowd! Unfortunately, I was not one of the lucky ones. üôÅ</p>
                    
                    <p>Jack started playing "Steady as she Goes" and towards the end interrupted the song to engage with the crowd asking "Now, L.A. have I asked too much of you tonight?" of course everyone shouts "NOOO!" So then Jack asks everyone if they could please get down on the ground and that when he sings "Steady as she goes" we reply with "are you steady now?" Everyone obeys of course and the exchange is awesome! Eventually we all got back up again and that's when I realized my pants were covered in beer! I guess since nobody wants to leave their spot to throw something away, the floor becomes a trash can.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course the band "leaves" the stage and then the crowd starts chanting for Jack to return-- we even break out into singing "Seven Nation Army!" Finally Jack enters the stage for his lengthy encore. Then all of a sudden, I see this dude dressed in the Elephant album outfit surfing the crowd! And right by me! I was fortunate enough to help pass the body along.</p>
                    
                    <p>As I watched as the band took their bows and said their goodbys, I thought to myself, this is truly the best night of my life." Yes I was tired, yes I was dehydrated, yes I was sweating like a pig, yes I was covered in beer, and yes my ears hurt like hell, but this was an AMAZING concert going experience and I hope to have more like it.</p>
